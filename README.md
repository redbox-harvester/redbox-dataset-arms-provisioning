Harvester configuration template
================================================================================
This project provides a skeleton harvester to use in conjunction with harvester-script-repository.
This repository contains the parent application context and code to run a generic harvester.

#### To use:
* There are 3 channels to choose from as well as any property configuration:
  * inbound
  * process
  * outbound
  * properties

* Choose 1 from each of the above in the harvester-script-repository and place in the same directory as the main application context.

* The layout follows the same model as other redbox-harvester projects.
